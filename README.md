I'm a software engineer who is passionate about solving business problems, creating technology that elevates people, and solves real world problems. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Angular, Python and Laravel.


I have worked with brands like UAC Foods and SPAR in delivering software solutions to help automate their business processes and customer satisfaction.
